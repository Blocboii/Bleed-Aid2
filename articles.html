        <p><strong>F</strong>DA approves once-weekly ALTUVIIIOâ„¢, a new class of factor VIII therapy  from Sanofi for hemophilia A that offers significant bleed protection. <br><br>

        ALTUVIIIO is administered parenterally  I am curious about the adoption of this treatment within the global hemophilia community, particularly considering their familiarity with subcutaneous treatments like Emicizumab. <br><br>

        Do the advantages of a once-weekly injection outweigh the disadvantages of intravenous administration with ALTUVIIIO? I would appreciate reading  your insights on this matter. <br><br>
